## Updating

In general, plugin updates should go smoothly. Though, if you experience some weird behaviour, reimport your project (using **Refresh Cargo project** action) or/and rebuild indices (using **Invalidate caches/Restart** action), prior to reporting bugs.

## Maybe it is a bug?

If neither of these tips helped you, do not hesitate to file an
[issue](https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/issues) on our bugtracker,
or ping us on our [chat](https://gitter.im/intellij-rust/intellij-rust).
